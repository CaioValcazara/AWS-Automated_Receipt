# AWS-Automated_Receipt
This project focuses on automating receipt processing using AWS services. Instead of manually handling receipts which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scaleâ€”this system extracts structured data from receipts and stores it efficiently for record-keeping and auditing.
